WSO2Telco Mobile Identity Gateway ${product.version}
==========================

Welcome to the WSO2Telco Mobile Identity Gateway ${product.version} release.

WSO2Telco Mobile Identity Gateway is an open source Identity and Entitlement management server. It supports a wide array of authentication 
protocols such as SAML 2.0 Web SSO, OAuth 2.0/1.0a, OpenID Connect and WS-Federation Passive.
It supports role based authorization and fined grained authorization with XACML 2.0/3.0 while inbound/outbound provisioning is 
supported through SCIM and SPML.

This is based on the revolutionary WSO2 Carbon framework. All the major features have been developed as pluggable Carbon components.

New Features
============

*   Back Channelling  - Server initiated authorize request capability without any browser interaction
*   Attribute sharing - Mobile Connect Attribute Sharing feature enables Operators to share information with Service Providers through acquiring user consent from the end user. This includes information about the user as well as details about their device, their account with the Operator and contextual information provided by the network. Currently, this architecture supports attribute provision (in which attribute values are provided to the SP). In a future phase, there will be ability to verify attribute values passed (attribute verification) by the SP against the Operatorâ€™s own user records.
*   Consent management - WSO2.Telco Hub API invocation tokens will be issued, via ID gateway once user provides the consent.  This will facilitate consent management for any API via MC.
*   Smart phone authenticator - Authentication for different business process can be done using biometric options available in Android devices.Currently this authenticator only supports  fingerprint and PIN to get the authentication from end user.

Secure sensitive information in carbon configuration files
----------------------------------------------------------

There are sensitive information such as passwords in the carbon configuration. 
You can secure them by using secure vault. Please go through following steps to 
secure them with default mode. 

1. Configure secure vault with default configurations by running ciphertool 
	script from bin directory.  

> ciphertool.sh -Dconfigure   (in UNIX)  

This script would do following configurations that you need to do by manually 

(i) Replaces sensitive elements in configuration files,  that have been defined in
		 cipher-tool.properties, with alias token values.  
(ii) Encrypts plain text password which is defined in cipher-text.properties file.
(iii) Updates secret-conf.properties file with default keystore and callback class. 

cipher-tool.properties, cipher-text.properties and secret-conf.properties files 
			can be found at repository/conf/security directory. 

2. Start server by running wso2server script from bin directory

> wso2server.sh   (in UNIX)

By default mode, it would ask you to enter the master password 
(By default, master password is the password of carbon keystore and private key) 

3. Change any password by running ciphertool script from bin directory.  

> ciphertool -Dchange  (in UNIX)
