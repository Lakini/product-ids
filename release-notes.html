    <h1>WSO2Telco Mobile Identity Gateway 2.4.0 Released!</h1>

    <p>
        The WSO2Telco team is pleased to announce the release of version 2.4.0 of
        the Open Source WSO2Telco Mobile Identity Gateway.
    </p>

    <p>

        The WSO2.Telco Mobile Identity Gateway is a standalone solution capable of being the backbone of a fully
        integrated ID Strategy including SSO, federated
        ID services and more. The ID Gateway is currently the only fully featured open source GSMA certified ID
        solution. MNO's can freely download this component
        and deploy Mobile Connect or build a PoC by carrying out integrations to their network elements. Further SPs and
        enterprises can use this solution to implement
        a federated ID solution for their own use.

        For Mobile Connect the WSO2.Telco Identity solution consists of authenticators for Levels of Assurance 2 and 3
        (LOA2, LOA3) including Header enrichment, SMS,
        USSD and Smartphone applications. The solution also works with third party SIM applets and is GSMA Mobile
        Connect, GSMA OneAPI V3 and ETSI 102.204 compliant.

        This is based on the revolutionary WSO2 Carbon framework. All the major features have been developed as
        pluggable Carbon components.

    <h2>New Features : </h2>

    <ul>
        <li>Back Channelling</li>
        <p>Server initiated authorize request capability without any browser interaction.</p></br>
        <li>Attribute sharing</li>
        <p>Mobile Connect Attribute Sharing feature enables Operators to share information
            with Service Providers through acquiring user consent from the end user.
            This includes information about the user as well as details about their device,
            their account with the Operator and contextual information provided by the network.
            Currently, this architecture supports attribute provision (in which attribute
            values are provided to the SP). In a future phase, there will be ability to verify
            attribute values passed (attribute verification) by the SP against the Operator?s
            own user records.</p>
        <li>Consent management</li>
        <p>WSO2.Telco Hub API invocation tokens will be issued, via ID gateway once user provides
            the consent.  This will facilitate consent management for any API via MC.</p>
        <li>Smart phone authenticator</li>
        <p>Authentication for different business process can be done using biometric options
            available in Android devices.Currently this authenticator only supports  fingerprint
            and PIN to get the authentication from end user.</p>
    </ul>

    <h2>Bug Fixes : </h2>

        <li>[IDSDEV-870] - Skipping user registration in API Consent page if user has already been created</li>
        <li>[IDSDEV-840] - Database table improvements</li>
        <li>[IDSDEV-841] - User cannot come back to the authentication flow, once he clicks links contained in T&C page. (Specially Mobile Phones)</li>
        <li>[IDSDEV-842] - IDSDEV-620 Change the customer Info API interface in premiumInfo endpoint implementation</li>
    </ul>
